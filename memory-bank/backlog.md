This feature establishes the Living Career Data Lake by aggregating professional artifacts stored on personal machine, with integrations

- Artifact Ingestion: Automatically parses your LinkedIn profile, existing resume versions, and personal project files to build a comprehensive "Master Profile".

- Technical Activity Synthesis: Scans locally accessible sources—including GitHub commit logs and exported Discord or Slack message archives—to extract evidence of technical problem-solving and collaboration.

- Credential Integration: Pulls data from sites to ensure the latest technical certifications and competencies are indexed for search. Prioritizes those likely to be available on personal computer vs purely behind employer firewalls
 - personal learning platforms (Udemy, Coursera, etc)
 - credential portals 

- Achievement Translation: Uses local inference to translate unstructured logs and commit histories into result-oriented bullet points that emphasize specific outcomes over generic duties.

### Hybrid Inference Toggle
Provides a single-click UI switch that allows users to toggle between Local Mode for total privacy (Ollama/Llama 3) and Cloud Mode for high-speed, complex reasoning (Groq/OpenAI). This ensures data sovereignty for sensitive information while maintaining a snappy user experience.

### Bespoke Layout Generator
Generates one-of-a-kind resume layouts dynamically tailored to the specific industry, audience, and job posting. Unlike static templates, this feature treats the resume as a malleable data object that adapts its visual hierarchy to emphasize the most relevant skills for the role.

### ATS "Robot View" Validator
Integrates a local parsing engine that reverse-engineers the generated PDF to show exactly how a recruiter’s Applicant Tracking System (ATS) interprets the content. This identifies formatting "breakers" like columns or icons, ensuring 100% data fidelity during submission.

### Real-Time Semantic Scoring
Provides a dynamic 0-100 "gap analysis" score that updates instantly as the user edits their content. It measures the semantic match between the resume and the job description keywords using low-latency inference to provide immediate feedback on optimization.

### Contextual Interview Simulator
A real-time, voice-to-voice mock interview tool powered by a local Whisper/TTS pipeline, utilizing the generated resume and target job description as context. This allows users to practice answering questions based on the specific tailoring generated by the AI.
